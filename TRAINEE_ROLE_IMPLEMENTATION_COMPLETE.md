## üîÑ Deployment Instructions

### Pre-Deployment:
1. **Backup database** - Critical before running migration
2. **Review migration** - Check `Migrations/20251004215820_AddTraineeRoleAndShadowing.cs`
3. **Test in staging** - Deploy to staging environment first

### Deployment Steps:
```bash
# 1. Stop application (if running)
# 2. Backup database
# 3. Run migration
dotnet ef database update --context AppDbContext

# 4. Restart application
# 5. Verify migration succeeded
```

### Post-Deployment Verification:
1. Check database schema has `TraineeUserId` column in `ShiftAssignments`
2. Create a test trainee user
3. Assign trainee to a test shift
4. Verify notifications are sent
5. Check My/Index shows shadowing correctly
6. Monitor logs for any errors

### Rollback Plan (If Needed):
```bash
# Rollback to previous migration
dotnet ef database update 20251003232434_AuditRoleAssignments --context AppDbContext
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Trainee not showing in dropdown
**Solution:** Verify user has `Role = 4` (Trainee) and `CompanyId` matches the shift

### Issue: Cannot assign trainee
**Solution:** Check that:
- Shift has a primary employee assigned
- No trainee already assigned to this shift
- Trainee has no time conflicts
- User has Manager/Director/Owner role

### Issue: Notifications not received
**Solution:** Check:
- NotificationService is registered in DI
- Database has UserNotifications table
- User hasn't disabled notifications

### Issue: Role change fails
**Solution:**
- To Trainee: Remove all active shifts first
- From Trainee: System auto-cancels shadowing (should work automatically)
