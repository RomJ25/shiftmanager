    ```csharp
    if (currentUser.Role == UserRole.Trainee)
    {
        var shadowed = await _db.ShiftAssignments
            .Include(sa => sa.ShiftInstance).ThenInclude(si => si.ShiftType)
            .Include(sa => sa.User)
            .Where(sa => sa.TraineeUserId == currentUserId && ...)
            .ToListAsync();
    }
    ```
- `Pages/My/Index.cshtml`

  - Show "Shadowing: {Employee Name}"
  - No edit/swap buttons for shadowed shifts

### 8. Employee View (Shifts with Trainees)
**Status:** Pending

## üìù Notes & Decisions

1. **TraineeUserId is nullable:** This allows shifts to exist without trainees. The FK is set to `ON DELETE SET NULL`.

2. **One trainee per shift:** Business rule enforced at application layer. If this changes, the database schema supports multiple trainees (would need to create a junction table).

3. **Role change behavior:** When changing FROM Trainee role, all shadowing assignments are automatically canceled with notifications. When changing TO Trainee role, validation ensures user has no active shifts.

4. **Time conflict logic:** Uses ShiftType Start/End times and ShiftInstance WorkDate to detect overlaps. Does not handle overnight shifts specially (assumes shift wrapping handled elsewhere).

5. **Notifications:** All 6 trainee-related notification types are sent automatically by TraineeService methods. No manual notification sending needed in UI code.
