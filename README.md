### Running Tests
```bash
dotnet test
```

**Current Coverage:** 15 unit tests (DirectorService only)
**Target Coverage:** 80% for service layer, 60% for presentation layer

### Database Management
```bash
# Create a new migration
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>

# Apply migrations
dotnet ef database update

# Rollback to specific migration
dotnet ef database update <MigrationName>

# Reset database to clean state
rm app.db
cp seed.db app.db
```

### Hot Reload (Development)
```bash
dotnet watch
```

---

## Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Flow
```
User Login → CompanyId Resolution → Query Filters
  → Automatic WHERE CompanyId = @current
  → CompanyIdInterceptor injects CompanyId on SaveChanges
```

### Key Services
- **NotificationService:** In-app notifications for shift changes
- **DirectorService:** Multi-company access validation
- **TraineeService:** Shadowing assignment management
- **ConflictChecker:** Prevent scheduling conflicts
- **LocalizationService:** Culture-aware formatting

---

## Deployment

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Set `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable
- [ ] Backup database before migrations
- [ ] Run migrations: `dotnet ef database update`
- [ ] Verify health check: `/health`
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors (first 24 hours)

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/health
# Expected: "Healthy"
```

## Email Configuration

ShiftManager supports **encrypted email notifications** for shift assignments, changes, and chore assignments. Email configuration is managed per-company with database storage and fallback to `appsettings.json`.

### Configuration Methods

#### Option 1: Admin UI (Recommended for Multi-Tenant)
1. Navigate to **Admin → Config** (`/Admin/Config`)
2. Scroll to **Email Configuration** section
3. Fill in the form:
   - ✅ **Enable Email Notifications** - Toggle on/off
   - 🔑 **API Key** - Stored encrypted using ASP.NET Data Protection
   - 🌐 **API URL** - Your email service endpoint
   - ✉️ **From Address** - Sender email address
4. Click **Save Email Configuration**

**Features:**
- ✅ API keys encrypted at rest (ASP.NET Data Protection API)
- ✅ Per-company configuration (multi-tenant support)
- ✅ Configuration priority: Database → appsettings.json
- ✅ Audit logging for configuration changes

#### Option 2: Configuration File (Fallback)
Edit `appsettings.Production.json` (see `appsettings.Production.template.json` for template):

```json
{
  "Email": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "ApiKey": "your-api-key-here",
    "ApiUrl": "https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/mail/send",
    "FromAddress": "noreply@yourcompany.com"
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Environment Variables (Most Secure for Production)
```bash
# Linux/macOS
export EMAIL__ENABLED=true
export EMAIL__APIKEY="your-api-key-here"
export EMAIL__APIURL="https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/mail/send"
export EMAIL__FROMADDRESS="noreply@yourcompany.com"

# Windows
set EMAIL__ENABLED=true
set EMAIL__APIKEY=your-api-key-here
set EMAIL__APIURL=https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/mail/send
set EMAIL__FROMADDRESS=noreply@yourcompany.com

# Docker
docker run -e EMAIL__ENABLED=true \
           -e EMAIL__APIKEY="your-api-key-here" \
           yourimage
```

### Email Types
- **Shift Assigned** - Notify employee when assigned to a shift
- **Shift Changed** - Notify when shift details are modified
- **Shift Deleted** - Notify when removed from a shift
- **Chore Assigned** - Notify when assigned a chore
- **Chore Canceled** - Notify when a chore is canceled

### Configuration Priority
1. **Database** (per-company, via Admin UI) → Highest priority
2. **Environment Variables** → Overrides appsettings.json
3. **appsettings.Production.json** → Fallback

### Security Features
- 🔐 API keys encrypted using ASP.NET Data Protection API
- 🔒 Purpose-based encryption (`ShiftManager.EmailConfig.v1`)
- 📝 Audit logging for configuration changes
- 🚫 Password input fields (never display API key in UI)
- ✅ Validation: URL format, email format, required fields

### Testing Email Configuration
After configuration, test by:
1. Assigning an employee to a shift
2. Check logs for email send attempts
3. Verify employee receives email notification

## Security

**Reporting Vulnerabilities:**
Please report security vulnerabilities to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)

**Security Features:**
- ✅ PBKDF2 password hashing (100k iterations, SHA256)
- ✅ CSRF protection (anti-forgery tokens)
- ✅ SQL injection protection (EF Core parameterized queries)
- ✅ XSS protection (Razor auto-escaping)
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation (query filters + validation)
- ✅ Role-based authorization (policies + service layer checks)

**Known Gaps (see [tasks.md](tasks.md)):**
- ⚠️ No rate limiting on login attempts
- ⚠️ No security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS)
- ⚠️ Database stored unencrypted (use SQLCipher for production)
